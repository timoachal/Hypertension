# 📊 BMI & Hypertension Analysis by Age Group (R) 🧑‍🔬

Welcome! This project presents an analysis of **Body Mass Index (BMI)** and **Hypertension** prevalence across various age groups using the R programming language.

## 📚 Overview

- **Objective:**  
  To explore the relationship between BMI and hypertension among different age groups.
- **Tools:**  
  R programming language, tidyverse, ggplot2, and supporting libraries.

## 📝 Key Steps

1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**  
   - Imported BMI and hypertension data  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Summarized BMI and hypertension stats by age group  
   - Visualized data distributions and trends
3. **Statistical Analysis**  
   - Investigated correlations between BMI and hypertension  
   - Compared hypertension risk across age groups
4. **Visualization**  
   - Created bar charts, boxplots, and scatterplots for clear insight


## 💡 Results

- Identified trends and risk factors linking higher BMI to hypertension in older age groups
- Provided actionable insights for health professionals and researchers

## 🛠️ How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repo:  
   ```bash
